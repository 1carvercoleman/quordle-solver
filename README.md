# quordle-solver

This code solves the daily Quordle. Right now, it generates the best guess for each quadrant and then picks the best of those 4. I'd prefer to just pick the best guess for all quadrants regardless of what the best guess is in any given quadrant, but I haven't figured out a way to make that go quickly.
